hey So This is the project where I used a pre-trained VGG16 model to identify various bird species from images. The dataset contains training, validation, and testing sets, and the model is fine-tuned to classify birds with high accuracy.

Birds play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance, and identifying them can help with species preservation efforts. This project classifies images of birds using deep learning. We employ a pre-trained VGG16 model from Keras, fine-tuning it to recognize specific bird species from the dataset.

Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into different bird species. The dataset is split into three directories:

train/: Contains the training images.
valid/: Contains validation images for model tuning.
test/: Contains test images to evaluate model performance.

Model Architecture
I utilized the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The modelâ€™s layers are frozen to retain the pre-trained weights, and a few dense layers are added at the end to customize the model for bird species classification.

Pre-processing using VGG16 includes resizing input images to 224x224 pixels.
A softmax activation function is used for multi-class classification.

Training
The model is trained for 5 epochs with categorical_crossentropy as the loss function and adam optimizer. We apply data augmentation techniques such as shear, zoom, and horizontal flips to enhance model generalization.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 84% on the training set and 80% on the validation set. Below are the training and validation loss/accuracy plots:
